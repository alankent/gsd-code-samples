# Getting Stuff Done with Magento 2 Book Series Support Files

This repository contains all the code samples for the "Getting Stuff Done with
Magento 2" book series. See http://alankent.me/gsd for details.

The files here are provided to save some typing if you are in a hurry.
(Personally I find doing the typing helps reinforce concepts in my memory.)
Please note that some exercises in the book make changes to the default
files. The book also sometimes reformatted the code for printing reasons.
